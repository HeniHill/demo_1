# Nest JS Backend Application.

## List of required Modules.

npm i -g @nestjs/cli
npm i @nestjs/mongoose mongoose
npm i class-validator class-transformer
npm i @nestjs/microservice
npm i @nestjs/cache-manager

## Database.

1. mongoos is used to create the schema
2. to transfer the data from client to server, the best practice is to use DTOâ€™s, therefore DTO are used for validation.
3. Class Validation is used globally.
    1. In the main.ts file.  **app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe())** 
    2. Controller level validation using @UsePipes(new ValidationPipe()) decorator.

I preferred the first approach.

## Exception Handling.

Usually when there is constraint violation in the model, the server fires an Internal Server Error (500), but to make the response fore clear and informative for the end users, custom exception handling is implemented using nestjs ExceptionFilter class.

**app.useGlobalFilters(new CustomExceptionFilter());**

## Caching

To implement in-memory caching for  routes in a NestJS application, I use the @nestjs/cache-manager module. This module provides efficient way to cache responses or data in memory.


CacheModule.register is imported in the app.module with ttl, no of items and is_global parameters.

In specific route (updateUserById) **cacheManager.get()** and **cacheManager.set()** used 

 

## Microservice for Incident Reporting.

When An incident is reported the backend microservice will emit an event for another microservice, which is responsible to listen new incident event and compose an email and send to list of responsible incident response team.
